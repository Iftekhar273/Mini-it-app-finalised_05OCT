1. Stick to a sleep schedule
   Set aside no more than eight hours for sleep. The recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is at least seven hours. 
   Most people don't need more than eight hours in bed to achieve this goal.

2. Pay attention to what you eat and drink
    Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. In particular, avoid heavy or large meals within a couple of hours of bedtime. Your discomfort might keep you up.

3. Create a restful environment
    Create a room that's ideal for sleeping. Often, this means cool, dark and quiet. Exposure to light might make it more challenging to fall asleep. 
    Avoid prolonged use of light-emitting screens just before bedtime. 

4. Limit daytime naps
    Long daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you choose to nap, limit yourself to up to 30 minutes and avoid doing so late in the day.

5. Include physical activity in your daily routine
    Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. Avoid being active too close to bedtime, however.


6. Manage worries
     Try to resolve your worries or concerns before bedtime. Jot down what's on your mind and then set it aside for tomorrow.
