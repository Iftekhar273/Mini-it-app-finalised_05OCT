1. Eat a variety of foods 
For good health, we need more than 40 different nutrients, and no single food can supply them all.
 It is not about a single meal, it is about a balanced food choice over time that will make a difference!

A high-fat lunch could be followed by a low-fat dinner.
After a large meat portion at dinner, perhaps fish should be the next day's choice?

2. Base your diet on plenty of foods rich in carbohydrates
About half the calories in our diet should come from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and bread. 
It is a good idea to include at least one of these at every meal. 
Wholegrain foods, like wholegrain bread, pasta, and cereals, will increase our fibre intake.

3. Replace saturated with unsaturated fat
Fats are important for good health and proper functioning of the body.
However, too much of it can negatively affect our weight and cardiovascular health.
Different kinds of fats have different health effects, and some of these tips could help us keep the balance right:

i)We should limit the consumption of total and saturated fats (often coming from foods of animal origin),
 and completely avoid trans fats; reading the labels helps to identify the sources.
ii)Eating fish 2-3 times a week, with at least one serving of oily fish,
 will contribute to our right intake of unsaturated fats.
iii)When cooking, we should boil, steam or bake, rather than frying,
 remove the fatty part of meat, use vegetable oils.
